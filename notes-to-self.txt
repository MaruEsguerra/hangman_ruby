# When new game starts, read and load the dictionary and RANDOMLY select a word between
# 5-12 chars long to be the game's secret word.

# No need for actual stick figure, but display a counter (likely how many guesses left)
# before the game ends. Would also be ideal to display which letters guesses are correct
# ex. tic tac toe but hangman? Like if word is persian then _ e _ _ i _ n. So letters are
# initially _ (perhaps loop)?

# Every turn counter, let player guess a letter. It SHOULD be case INSENSITIVE. Update the display to
# reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.

# When this all works, implement an option where at the story of any turn, instead of making player
# guess, they may save the game if they opt to. This is focused on serialization (YAML, JSON, etc.)

# After that, when program first loads, add option that allows you to open one of your saved games,
# which should jump back to exactly where you were when you saved.

# New topics: Files and Serialization -> reading and writing for saved game + dictionary, yaml/json
# for saving. Serializing + unserializing module mixin?

# Necessary stuff:
# Classes: Game, Player, Board, Word* (for the secret word or implement in Game?)
# Module: Serialization mixin

# Double check if a Saving Class is necessary or if required saving data is in Game or Player Class.
